# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Emma Macey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 30th, Saturday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D1 
Sketched on paper my layout for my Guess the DOCTOR WHO game, found some new Javascript to Add to the code, experimented with background images for the, and tried to resize my CSS TARDIS, to make it more responsive. 

### R1D2
I worked on resizing my CSS TARDIS today to suit the new layout. Had some difficulty measuring the px, but  Getting closer to completing the resize and looking forward to working on the Javascript for the project.

### R1D3 
I was able to complete the resizing of my CSS TARDIS, it took more time than i thought, but i got it done. Then I spent some time trying to figure out how to create a door handle and lock with only CSS I will see how that goes tomorrow. #100DaysOfCode

### R1D4
Made a CSS lock for the CSS TARDIS and changed the heading. Hope to have the handles made tomorrow. Also working throught The Odin Project lessons and really enjoying the content.

### R1D5
Made a handle using CSS today. It was very small and hard to position. It seems like I am taking my time to get the work done, but I am learning so much about CSS, thanks  to The Odin project and #100DaysOfCode  

### R1D6
 Updated to Ubuntu 17.10, spent time using command line to configure and install new drivers etc. Also completed setting my lock and handle in place on the CSS TARDIS project have been working on.

 I got stuck with the installing of drivers etc, because I wanted to do some code, but realised when in command line I was using code, it was just a different language.

### R1D7
 Today I spent a few hours completing the JavaScript assignments for the Fundamentals part 2 lessons.
 I found it difficult to complete the assignments at first and had a sense of failure, until I figured out how to convert a string into a number and solved it. Then I was impressed with my effort and had a little hope that I can actually learn Javascript.

### R1D8
 Spent some time adding buttons and content to the CSS TARDIS game, getting ready to apply javascript to the DOM. I'm a little nervous about that, but I'm looking forward to making progress. 

### R1D9
 Started editing the javascript for the Guess who game. I tried to learn more about DOM, so i can alter the HTML and make the game interactive. I also tried to figure out if I can use switch approriately instead of using loads of If else statements.
### R1D10
Today I spent some time learning about DOM manipulation the odin Project and working on some of the assignments. 
https://github.com/macey26/assignment-practice
Also some software difficulties on my computer, so has some fun with command line.

### R1D11
Today I did some more work on my Javascript game and learned some more DOM manipulation for the game in @The Odin Project. I am worried I won't be able to apply what I am learning to the Game.
 
###R1D12
 Still learning more about DOM manipulation for my project today. I am still not sure I am understanding how to apply what I am learning to my project. I hope it sinks in after I get through all the DOM rescources on the Odin project 
### R1D13
I completed some Javascript function practice and started the rock paper scissors project on the Odin Project. 
I am looking forward to doing the project because I think I will learn a lot of things I can apply to my Dr who game.

###R1D14
I created my first function for the rock, paper, scissors game. The function randomly generates a number between 0 an 2 using math.random. I had a lot of syntax errors at first, but found a sense of relief when worked.   

###R1D15
Today I created another function for my rock, paper, scissors project and tried to add a switch statement to the code.   
My head has been spinning in circles trying to figure out the code, but I am excited that I'm understanding some of what I am doing.

###R1D16
Spent some more time on switch statement for the rock paper scissors project. Also practiced some functions and DOM manipulation to my DR who game.  

###R1D17
Doing some work with functions, for the rock paper scissors game. Im am not sure I understand function returns or scope yet. I guess I can learn more tomorrow. 

Feel a little defeated by today, but made some good progress on a few things.

###R1D18
 Working on my rock paper scissors project, learning more about functions and conditionals as I go.  

its going slowly slowly, but I am determinded not to give up on it.

### R1D19 
Stuck on a function, it keeps returning undefined when I run it, spent hours on it work and its probably the simplest solution. Can anyone see what I have done wrong?

### R1D20
Thanks to @fultonium helping me with my function return, I was able to complete the script for that function and create the next function for my Rock paper scissors game. 
I feel a real sense of accomplishment and I feel i understand functions and conditionals a whole lot better.

### R1D21
Spent some time making a loop for my Rock Paper Scissors game, that was interesting. Also read some of Scope and Closures from the @YDKJS series.

### R1D22
I completed the console version of my rock paper scissors game.
I was so excited about getting through it, its made my day.

###R1D23
Learnt about clean code and cleaned up the code for my Rock Paper Scissors game. I think I am getting a well rounded education @theOdinProject

###R1D24
I spend some time learning arrays on @theOdinProject and started working on functions for my Dr Who Game. Looking forward to 3 weeks off work and more time to code.

###R1D25
I spents some time learning more about loops in javascript and added more functions to my DR WHO game.
Trying to figure out how to apply a loop the game too.

###R1D26
I did some exercises using while loops and started some practiced test driven development exercises @theOdinProject. I'm off camping for the next 3 days with my @YDKJS Scopes and Closures book.

###R1D27 Read about block scope & hoisting in @YDKJS Scope & Closures. It has been a challenge to find space and time while camping, but I did it.

### R1D28
Spent some time reading about closures @YDKJS also did some reading up on loops. 

### R1D29
Spent some time reading more about loops and did some loop practice in the console. 

### R1D30
I spent some time trying to install jasmine.js on Ubuntu, found it challenging because npm is having issues, I worked through a jasmine tutorial to get the idea of how it works.

###R1D31
I was able to install jasmine.js  with some help from @NickWilde1990
and @v8areU (thanks to both of you) I got started on the @theOdinProject #javascript exercises
#100DaysOfCode

###R1D32
Today I completed reverse a string and repeat a string on @theOdinProject test driven development exercises. 
 
I had some serious doubts about my abilities, but was so happy when I passed all the tests
#100DaysOfCode

###R1D33
Today I worked on the removeFromArray test development exercise from @theOdinProject I passed the first test, then spent time learning more about optional arguments.

###R1D34/D35
Still working on removing multiple items from an array using arguments. I'm reading up on the arguments object, but not sure get it. I will keep trying. Didn't tweet yesterday there wasn't much to report.
#100DaysOfCode 

###R1D36
My internet connection was down, so I spent some time readining @ydkjs and practicing the examples in it.

###R1D37
I spent some time reading @ydkjs and practicing the examples in it. I think this book is so helpful, in my mission learn javascript.

### R1D38/39
I spent more time on the removeFromArray exercise then, finally solved it, then started on the sumAll Exercises from @TheOdinProject.

Is it wrong that each time I start a new algorithm I want to peek at someone elses code to see what I am working towards? 

###R1D40
Wrote down options for  the sumAll Exercise @TheOdinProject.

Not too sure I have figured out what I am doing yet, but I am going to try. 

###R1D41
Passed the first 2 tests for the sumAll Exercise @TheOdinProject. Learnt a lot more about operators and loops.
