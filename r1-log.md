## Log

### R1D1 
Sketched on paper my layout for my Guess the DOCTOR WHO game, found some new Javascript to Add to the code, experimented with background images for the, and tried to resize my CSS TARDIS, to make it more responsive. 

### R1D2
I worked on resizing my CSS TARDIS today to suit the new layout. Had some difficulty measuring the px, but  Getting closer to completing the resize and looking forward to working on the Javascript for the project.

### R1D3 
I was able to complete the resizing of my CSS TARDIS, it took more time than i thought, but i got it done. Then I spent some time trying to figure out how to create a door handle and lock with only CSS I will see how that goes tomorrow. #100DaysOfCode

### R1D4
Made a CSS lock for the CSS TARDIS and changed the heading. Hope to have the handles made tomorrow. Also working throught The Odin Project lessons and really enjoying the content.

### R1D5
Made a handle using CSS today. It was very small and hard to position. It seems like I am taking my time to get the work done, but I am learning so much about CSS, thanks  to The Odin project and #100DaysOfCode  

### R1D6
 Updated to Ubuntu 17.10, spent time using command line to configure and install new drivers etc. Also completed setting my lock and handle in place on the CSS TARDIS project have been working on.

 I got stuck with the installing of drivers etc, because I wanted to do some code, but realised when in command line I was using code, it was just a different language.
