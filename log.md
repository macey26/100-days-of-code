# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 30th December 2017


**Today's Progress**: Sketched on paper my layout for my Guess who game, experimented with background images, and tried to resize my CSS TARDIS, to make it more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to find the right background images. I got frustrated with the tardis size, because i have already resized it once, but i guess i didn't make it small enough last time.

### Day 2: December 31st, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS to resize the TARDIS, I am getting closer to finishing off the resize, to suit the new layout.

**Thoughts**: So Tired after work could barely see through my tired eyes, but pushed through it and made a bit of progress. So glad i got through some of it

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
