# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 30th December 2017


**Today's Progress**: Sketched on paper my layout for my Guess who game, experimented with background images, and tried to resize my CSS TARDIS, to make it more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to find the right background images. I got frustrated with the tardis size, because i have already resized it once, but i guess i didn't make it small enough last time.

### Day 2: December 31st, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS to resize the TARDIS, I am getting closer to finishing off the resize, to suit the new layout.

**Thoughts**: So Tired after work could barely see through my tired eyes, but pushed through it and made a bit of progress. So glad i got through some of it

### Day 3: January 1st, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the resize for the CSS TARDIS, tried to figure out how to make a handle and lock purely with CSS. I hope to get started on that tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I worried about not being very fast at completing the task, but if I look back I am saving more time by doing less searching to find out the best property to use in the CSS

### Day 4: January 2nd, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS lock for the CSS TARDIS and changed the heading. Also working throught The Odin Project Javascript lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am really happy with the CSS lock and impressed I could figure out how the CSS for it. I will just need to resize it.

### Day 5: January 3rd, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made a handle using CSS today. It was very small and hard to position. Worked on getting the lock and handle fixed into position, it still needs work, but I'm getting there.

**Thoughts**: It seems like I am taking my time to get the work done, but I feel like I am learning so much about CSS.
