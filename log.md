# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 30th December 2017


**Today's Progress**: Sketched on paper my layout for my Guess who game, experimented with background images, and tried to resize my CSS TARDIS, to make it more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to find the right background images. I got frustrated with the tardis size, because i have already resized it once, but i guess i didn't make it small enough last time.

### Day 2: December 31st, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS to resize the TARDIS, I am getting closer to finishing off the resize, to suit the new layout.

**Thoughts**: So Tired after work could barely see through my tired eyes, but pushed through it and made a bit of progress. So glad i got through some of it

### Day 3: January 1st, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the resize for the CSS TARDIS, tried to figure out how to make a handle and lock purely with CSS. I hope to get started on that tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I worried about not being very fast at completing the task, but if I look back I am saving more time by doing less searching to find out the best property to use in the CSS

### Day 4: January 2nd, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS lock for the CSS TARDIS and changed the heading. Also working throught The Odin Project Javascript lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am really happy with the CSS lock and impressed I could figure out how the CSS for it. I will just need to resize it.

### Day 5: January 3rd, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made a handle using CSS today. It was very small and hard to position. Worked on getting the lock and handle fixed into position, it still needs work, but I'm getting there.

**Thoughts**: It seems like I am taking my time to get the work done, but I feel like I am learning so much about CSS.

### Day 6: January 4th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Updated to Ubuntu 17.10, spent time using command line to configure and install new drivers etc. Also completed setting my lock and handle in place on the CSS TARDIS

**Thoughts**: I got stuck with the installing of drivers etc, because I wanted to do some code, but realised when in command line I was using code, it was just a different language.

### Day 7: January 6th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: I managed to do 50 minutes of The Odin Project Javascript assignemts Yesterday.
Today I spent a few hours completing the JavaScript assignments for the Fundamentals part 2 lessons.

**Thoughts**: I found it difficult to complete the assignments at first and had a sense of failure, until I figured out how to convert a string into a number and solved it. Then I was impressed with my effort and had a little hope that I can learn Javascript.

### Day 8: January 7th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Spent some time adding buttons and content to the CSS TARDIS game, to get ready to apply DOM Code to Javascript. 

**Thoughts**:I am happy with the progress I have made so far, getting nervous about adding in the Javascript, because I am worried I will Ruin it.

### Day 9: January 8th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Did some editing of the javascript for the Guess who game and tried to learn more about DOM so the javascript alter HTML for the game to be interactive. I also tried to figure out if I can use switch approriately instead of using loads of If else statements.

**Thoughts**:I was frustrated with the switch statements, so moved onto the DOM and felt so much better with the dom. I really enjoyed the content for DOM on the odin project

### Day 10: January 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time learning about DOM manipulation in the odin Project and working on some of the assignments. Also some software difficulties on my computer, so has some fun with command line.

**Thoughts** Really annoyed with my computer problems, but glad i could do some command line. I think I am slowly getting the DOM

### Day 12: January 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learnt more about DOM manipulation for my game project today. I am still not sure I am getting how to apply what I am learning to my project.

**Thoughts** I am still not sure I am understanding how to apply what I am learning to my project. I hope it sinks in after I get through all the DOM rescources on the Odin project
