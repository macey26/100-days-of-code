# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 30th December 2017


**Today's Progress**: Sketched on paper my layout for my Guess who game, experimented with background images, and tried to resize my CSS TARDIS, to make it more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time trying to find the right background images. I got frustrated with the tardis size, because i have already resized it once, but i guess i didn't make it small enough last time.

### Day 2: December 31st, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS to resize the TARDIS, I am getting closer to finishing off the resize, to suit the new layout.

**Thoughts**: So Tired after work could barely see through my tired eyes, but pushed through it and made a bit of progress. So glad i got through some of it

### Day 3: January 1st, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the resize for the CSS TARDIS, tried to figure out how to make a handle and lock purely with CSS. I hope to get started on that tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I worried about not being very fast at completing the task, but if I look back I am saving more time by doing less searching to find out the best property to use in the CSS

### Day 4: January 2nd, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS lock for the CSS TARDIS and changed the heading. Also working throught The Odin Project Javascript lessons.

**Thoughts**: I am really happy with the CSS lock and impressed I could figure out how the CSS for it. I will just need to resize it.

### Day 5: January 3rd, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Made a handle using CSS today. It was very small and hard to position. Worked on getting the lock and handle fixed into position, it still needs work, but I'm getting there.

**Thoughts**: It seems like I am taking my time to get the work done, but I feel like I am learning so much about CSS.

### Day 6: January 4th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Updated to Ubuntu 17.10, spent time using command line to configure and install new drivers etc. Also completed setting my lock and handle in place on the CSS TARDIS

**Thoughts**: I got stuck with the installing of drivers etc, because I wanted to do some code, but realised when in command line I was using code, it was just a different language.

### Day 7: January 6th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: I managed to do 50 minutes of The Odin Project Javascript assignemts Yesterday.
Today I spent a few hours completing the JavaScript assignments for the Fundamentals part 2 lessons.

**Thoughts**: I found it difficult to complete the assignments at first and had a sense of failure, until I figured out how to convert a string into a number and solved it. Then I was impressed with my effort and had a little hope that I can learn Javascript.

### Day 8: January 7th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Spent some time adding buttons and content to the CSS TARDIS game, to get ready to apply DOM Code to Javascript.

### Day 9: January 8th, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Did some editing of the javascript for the Guess who game and tried to learn more about DOM so the javascript alter HTML for the game to be interactive. I also tried to figure out if I can use switch approriately instead of using loads of If else statements.

**Thoughts**:I was frustrated with the switch statements, so moved onto the DOM and felt so much better with the dom. I really enjoyed the content for DOM on the odin project
